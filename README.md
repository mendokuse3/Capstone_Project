# Capstone_Project

## Concept

A working full-stack CRUD application using Ruby on Rails with React and Redux, allowing ALTTPR players to manage their items during game. ALTTPR is a hacked version of Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past in which all of the items of the game are randomly shuffled around, forcing the player to progress through the game by finding required items in order to gain access to more items and beat the game, similar to a puzzle.  This tracker is meant to be used along side the game to keep track of what items a player has found and to provide a place to write notes about item locations or in other randomizer modes, to write about entrance locations/pairings.
